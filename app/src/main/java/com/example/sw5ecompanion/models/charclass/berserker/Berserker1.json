It ends early if you are knocked uncoscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since or last turn or taken damage since then.  You can also end your rage as a bonus action.  Once you have raged the number of times shown for your Berserker level in the Rages column of the Berserker table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again."], ["Unarmored Defence", "While you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.  you can use a shield and still gain this benefit"]]
