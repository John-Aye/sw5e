The secured area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power. When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaected by any or all of the eects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these eects. When commanded (no action required), s e cu rit y pr o t o cols creates the following eects within the secured area. C o r r i d o r s . Fog lls all the secured corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage oering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses. D o o r s . All doors in the secured area are locked, as if sealed by the lo ck power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the mi n o r h olo g r a m power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall. S t a i r s . Electromesh lls all stairs in the secured area from top to bottom, as the ele ct r o me s h power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while s e cu rit y pr o t o cols lasts. O t h e r p o w e r e f f e c t . You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced eects within the secured area of the stronghold. Place mo bile lig h t s in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as s e cu rit y pr o t o cols lasts. Place impl a n t me s s a g e in two locations. Place de bilit a tin g g a s in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while s e cu rit y pr o t o cols lasts. The whole secured area radiates power. A di mi s h t e ch cast on a specic eect, if successful, removes only that eect. You can create a permanently guarded and secured structure by casting this power there every day for one year.");
